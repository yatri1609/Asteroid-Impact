# **Asteroid Impact Prediction 🚀☄️**  

## **Overview**  
Asteroid Impact Prediction is a **machine learning-based project** that predicts the probability of an asteroid impacting Earth based on key orbital parameters. The model utilizes **NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset** to analyze asteroid trajectories, velocities, and distances to assess collision risks.  

## **Features**  
- ✅ **Predicts asteroid impact probability** based on key orbital features  
- ✅ **Utilizes real NASA NEO data** for training and evaluation  
- ✅ **Explores multiple ML algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks)  
- ✅ **Feature engineering & data preprocessing** for improved accuracy  
- ✅ **Visualizes asteroid trajectories** with interactive plots  
- ✅ **Interpretable results** with model explainability techniques  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset is sourced from **NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) database**, containing asteroid characteristics such as:  
- **Absolute Magnitude (H)**  
- **Estimated Diameter (km)**  
- **Miss Distance (AU, km, Lunar)**  
- **Relative Velocity (km/s)**  
- **Orbit Determination Parameters**  

## **Technologies Used**  
- 🔹 **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow)  
- 🔹 **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks)  
- 🔹 **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- 🔹 **NASA NEO Dataset** for real-world asteroid data
